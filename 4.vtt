00:00:02.072 --> 00:00:03.614
No time to lose!

00:00:03.614 --> 00:00:06.126
What is your presentation about again?

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:08.324
Belgium.

00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:09.634
Belgium?!

00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:12.859
Just leave it to Mymy....

00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:18.314
Haha, wow!

00:00:18.314 --> 00:00:19.039
That was...

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.202
...very racist.

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:21.602
Belgians aren't a race!

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:24.756
Let us consult a more reliable source.

00:00:26.847 --> 00:00:27.905
According to this book....

00:00:27.905 --> 00:00:30.240
...Belgium was, in the Burgundian era...

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.292
...well known for its beautiful paintings.

00:00:32.292 --> 00:00:34.080
Ours were prettier.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.985
In the Habsburgian era they engaged in lots of trading.

00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:38.308
We traded more.

00:00:38.308 --> 00:00:40.574
And in the colonial era...

00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:42.318
[swears in Afrikaans]

00:00:42.318 --> 00:00:44.318
Yeah, okay, they can have that one.

00:00:44.318 --> 00:00:47.797
 What if I write a piece about the paintings...

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:49.501
...then Maya can do the trade...

00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:51.000
...and Mymy....

00:00:52.054 --> 00:00:54.000
...the animations between the slides.

00:00:54.538 --> 00:00:58.536
But animaaation taaakes so loooooong-

00:00:59.554 --> 00:01:01.582
All clear, Maya?

00:01:02.937 --> 00:01:04.456
Uh... yes?

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:06.639
Great. You can do it!

00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:10.570
Yeah...

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.903
...yeah I can do it!

00:01:11.903 --> 00:01:13.910
Half an hour of working together isn't that ba-

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.707
Hey Maya, where do you sit during break?

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.979
Maya sits with her friends.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.349
Isn't that right, Maya?

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.724
Yes.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:24.868
Oh.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.481
So who are your friends?

00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:29.395
Mymy...

00:01:29.395 --> 00:01:30.943
And, why does your bed creak at ni-

00:01:30.943 --> 00:01:31.877
You know what?!

00:01:31.877 --> 00:01:34.206
I can't concentrate here after all, I'm off!

00:01:34.206 --> 00:01:36.114
No no no Maya, don't go-

00:01:36.114 --> 00:01:38.646
No! I'd rather sit through another year!

00:01:38.646 --> 00:01:39.863
Then why are you standing up?

00:01:39.863 --> 00:01:43.162
But Maya, we really want to work together with you!

00:01:44.531 --> 00:01:45.559
Why?!

00:01:46.628 --> 00:01:47.876
Yeah, why?

00:01:47.876 --> 00:01:50.449
Because that would be fun?

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.761
And because we're family...

00:01:57.307 --> 00:02:01.004
...and because I don't want you to feel lonely...

00:02:03.883 --> 00:02:04.755
...because...

00:02:05.914 --> 00:02:11.067
...because I know you don't have any friends.

00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:20.455
Rather no friends than no parents.

00:02:24.957 --> 00:02:27.905
I'm not hearing hear any apologies, Maya!

00:02:29.344 --> 00:02:30.863
I-I'm sorry!

00:02:49.248 --> 00:02:51.554
On the bright side...

00:02:51.554 --> 00:02:52.893
...the animation is done.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.023
TO BE CONCLUDED

00:03:07.023 --> 00:03:11.440
THIS PART WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.760
