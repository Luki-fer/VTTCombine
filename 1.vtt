00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.960
Studio Massa presents

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.660
An original Dutch animated pilot

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.520
Senpai, I have loved always of you

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.600
I know

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.640
Senpai, please gentle!

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.680
No

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.680
Hey Maya!

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.040
Oh hey *cough*

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.860
Oh, uhm, hey! Coco! Uhm....

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.860
...didn't you notice anything about my door?

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.160
Hmm?

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.720
Oh, now that you mention it, yeah!

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.060
What are you doing?

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.580
NOTHING

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.000
I was just, eh...

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.160
Appreciating landscape art.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.200
Oh, what a wonderful pastime!

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.640
I myself am a great admirer of Pierneef's geometrical landscape studies from the twenties.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.720
Who's your favorite painter?

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.440
Eh...

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.520
Hitler?

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.760
Hmm, uhm...

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.440
So, the history presentations are tomorrow, and I'm having some... uhm...

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.320
...technical problems?

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.160
Oh, uhm... so what happened?

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.720
Eh, have you tried turning it off and on again?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.600
But then I thought...

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.840
Hey, Maya is always on the computer, so she probably knows everything about making presentations.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.080
So what'd you think about working together &lt;gezelligly&gt;?

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.200
I'm stuck.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.480
I've tried to move forward.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.000
I really did, but...

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.040
....every time I try...

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.440
...I only make it worse for myself.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.760
No, really.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.040
I'm not even being metaphorical, I really am stuck.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.920
No panic...

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.920
Remember, it's just a phase...

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.080
...nothing to worry about....

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.640
Just imagine it...

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.360
...no school...

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.680
...no adoptive sisters...

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.560
...no eternal ex  -

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.720
Blimey! These aren't spices...

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.080
Uhm, Mymy, what are you doing-

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.680
Well well well, just as I thought!

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.920
We've captured a cowardly deserter!

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.160
Uhm, could you perhaps, untie me-

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.240
Silence, barbaric Belgian!

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.720
On the orders of the Lords XVII, every single traitor has to be extrajudicially keelhauled!

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.960
Eh, I'm from Brabant, actually...

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.160
But, for such a...

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.800
...DELICATE specimen, I can think of a more useful ACTIVITY...

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.560
...if you know what I mean...

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.040
Oh, are you going to colonize my Virgin Islands?

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.000
No.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.520
You get a one-way-ticket to the RICE FIELDS, you filthy sodomite!

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.720
What are you thinking of your bloody sister, Fritzl?

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.120
Uhm, well, technically, in case of adoption it's not-

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.840
IMPLYING?!

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.640
Uhm, I mean, I was just playing along!

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.240
Ugh, this is THEATRE, not one of those decadent

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.240
oriental animated films of yours!

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.640
Do you even read my articles in the school paper?

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.000
"ANIME:
JAP CAMPS FOR THE SOUL"

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.560
Nothing personal Maya,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.160
I'm just somewhat exalted for the most important day of the year?!

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.640
Could you untie me-

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.920
HISTORY PRESENTATION DAY!

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.960
Behold!

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.040
I've really surpassed myself this year Maya!

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.800
My performance will be so awe-inspiring, I'll finally be promoted to class representative!

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.560
Or, in other words...

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.880
ABSOLUTE EMPRESS OVER THE SERVING UNTERMENSCH-

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.800
That's NOT what a class representative does-

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.880
I assure you Maya,

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.840
tomorrow you'll get a history presentation you won't soon forget!

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.520
"h"

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.320
"hist"

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.400
AHHH!

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.160
Puss.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.000
Now where do I get my history from?

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.280
"History"
"34 tabs"

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.040
...and that was my presentation.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.460
Any questions?

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.760
Yeah no, that was literally just a list of reasons why you should be class representative...

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.560
...it had absolutely nothing to do with history at all.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.060
Hey, hey, I... I  also talked about slavery...

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.060
Eh, yeah, the reinstatement of slavery, of...

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.480
...first years?

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.360
Yeah no, you failed so you'll have to resit.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.220
Nuh-uh.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.580
Mymy, not this again...

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.680
I'm gonna do it!

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.380
I'll do a... schoolocaust, unless I become class representative.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.820
Mymy, this is not America.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.980
Watch out! These bullets are reusable!

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.160
No standing on the tables.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.100
After class, resit scheduling in my office.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.460
Nice play at the end!

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.320
Play?

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.880
The next presentation is from...

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.180
...Maya.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.720
I-I have a... presentation?

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.860
Maya...

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.160
...EVERYONE has a presentation.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.660
Uhm... oh!

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.000
I believe I was sick, on the day that we got-

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.620
And there was NOBODY to catch you up?

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.400
Uhm...

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.560
So, the history presentations are tomorrow...

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.840
HISTORY PRESENTATION DAY!

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.380
No.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.680
After class, my office.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.980
Coco.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.560
Presentation. By Coco.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.140
Hello, everybody.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.420
My presentation is about the history of love.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.960
Specifically:

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.720
Mollusk love in ancient Japan.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.520
Nowadays, it's very normal for girls to fall in love with other boys.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.300
But in Japan, girls also fell in love with octopi.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.380
This might sound strange, but it was all in the history.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.240
In fact, I have found an animated film that has illustrated this love.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.160
Let's have a look!

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.900
What did I do wrong?

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.400
Don't mind me it's only me

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.980
See right through me

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.380
I'd much rather die than go out

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.940
So please leave me alone

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.800
Don't perceive me

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.520
It's only me
