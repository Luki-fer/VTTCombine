00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.592
So...

00:00:02.374 --> 00:00:03.950
...this is how it ends.

00:00:11.208 --> 00:00:12.903
That's, uh...

00:00:12.903 --> 00:00:15.352
...no happily ever after for me.

00:00:22.715 --> 00:00:25.200
Uh... yes. The last words.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.024
Uhm, now, uh, yes...

00:00:28.024 --> 00:00:29.358
...so long, eh.

00:00:34.713 --> 00:00:38.309
Wooow, I'm nearly losing my balance, aaaah...

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.806
Maya.

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:45.686
You're cringe.

00:00:56.476 --> 00:00:59.591
~Because that would be fun?~

00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:03.198
~And because we're family...~

00:01:04.285 --> 00:01:08.228
~...and because I don't want you to feel lonely...~

00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:15.081
~...because I know you don't have any friends.~

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.384
Shut your mouth, orphan!

00:01:20.457 --> 00:01:21.000
What?

00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:22.948
Mind your own business!

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.290
What?!

00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:30.888
Get the typhus.

00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:39.457
I'm not... lonely!

00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:42.855
Loneliness is an extravert conspiracy.

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:45.659
I don't need any of you.

00:01:47.197 --> 00:01:50.896
The only friend that I need...

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:52.073
...is...

00:01:52.073 --> 00:01:52.914
...MY PRESENTATION!

00:01:58.184 --> 00:01:59.333
Oh!

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:00.417
Hey Maya!

00:02:01.013 --> 00:02:02.358
There you are!

00:02:04.903 --> 00:02:06.000
First of all...

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.179
...my sincere apologies for the death threat.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.140
I should not have done that.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.519
But we really need to go to the computer lab right now!

00:02:17.446 --> 00:02:20.282
But I don't have a presentation?

00:02:21.414 --> 00:02:22.546
Uhm...

00:02:22.546 --> 00:02:26.081
...you have ONE presentation...

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.590
Belgium?!

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.433
Just leave it to Mymy...

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.592
NOOOOOOOO

00:02:35.592 --> 00:02:36.682
Don't panic!

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.378
I gave her some...

00:02:38.378 --> 00:02:40.680
...points for improvement.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.402
...and, that was my presentation?

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.436
You know...

00:02:54.436 --> 00:02:57.000
...that sounded quite a lot like something that...

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.151
...MYMY would present.

00:03:01.722 --> 00:03:04.331
But it wasn't racist so it probably wasn't.

00:03:05.763 --> 00:03:08.099
I'll give you a...

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.226
...pass.

00:03:09.226 --> 00:03:12.352
But you really need to work on your eye contact.

00:03:12.352 --> 00:03:15.629
You can't interest the audience if you don't...

00:03:29.024 --> 00:03:29.641
What?!

00:03:33.896 --> 00:03:34.530
UHM!

00:03:34.623 --> 00:03:36.707
Uh-huh... h-hello?!

00:03:39.557 --> 00:03:40.941
Hey Maya.

00:03:40.941 --> 00:03:42.534
Uhm...

00:03:42.534 --> 00:03:45.254
...Mymy and I are going to play a game.

00:03:45.638 --> 00:03:47.056
Care to join us?

00:03:56.242 --> 00:03:57.601
N-no.

00:04:00.451 --> 00:04:01.490
Very well.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.705
Uhm...

00:04:02.705 --> 00:04:04.375
...have a nice evening.

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:28.992
Don't talk to me, together I feel more alone

00:04:28.992 --> 00:04:33.365
Forget my name, you and I have nothing in common

00:04:33.365 --> 00:04:37.783
There is no point in introducing me

00:04:37.783 --> 00:04:42.090
I know my place, in a long line, in the back

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.434
I know myself, and I don't recommend her to anyone

00:04:46.434 --> 00:04:55.153
She's worth ignoring for good

00:04:55.153 --> 00:04:59.522
I always said I was different from the rest

00:04:59.522 --> 00:05:03.732
Now I stay quiet, before I ruin your mood

00:05:03.732 --> 00:05:08.261
I'm getting addicted to isolating myself

00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:12.618
The free time in which I did not enjoy myself

00:05:12.618 --> 00:05:16.988
The memories I have never experienced

00:05:16.988 --> 00:05:23.052
Am I traumatizing myself?

00:05:23.052 --> 00:05:25.558
Don't mind me it's only me

00:05:25.558 --> 00:05:27.000
See right though me

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.876
I'd much rather die than go out

00:05:29.876 --> 00:05:32.016
So please leave me alone

00:05:32.016 --> 00:05:34.137
Don't perceive me

00:05:34.137 --> 00:05:36.551
It's only me
