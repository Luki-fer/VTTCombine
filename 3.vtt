[GOOD LUCK COCO]

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.652
[history of belgium]

00:00:32.338 --> 00:00:33.610
Hi Maya!

00:00:34.358 --> 00:00:35.001
Oh hey.

00:00:35.411 --> 00:00:37.259
May I ask you something?

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.491
Where do you sit during break, Maya?

00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:44.160
Who are your friends, Maya?

00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:46.161
Why does your bed creak at night, Maya?

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:47.261
I-I-I have, uh...

00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:48.000
...Parkinson's.

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:49.161
What?

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.867
I asked if you wanted to work together with us...

00:00:53.258 --> 00:00:53.912
What?

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:55.755
Well...

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:58.573
..our presentations need to be finished in 2 hours...

00:00:58.573 --> 00:01:02.301
...and we were wondering if we could help you out...

00:01:02.301 --> 00:01:03.671
...especially now with your Parkinson's...

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:06.402
I don't have Parkinson's.

00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.416
You don't have Parkinson's.

00:01:14.735 --> 00:01:15.378
I know.

00:01:15.378 --> 00:01:17.650
You are a healthy, lively...

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.152
....autist.

00:01:18.152 --> 00:01:21.792
I don't have autism, I have A-D-D!

00:01:21.792 --> 00:01:23.716
Wow, ADD!

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.108
What does that stand for?

00:01:25.346 --> 00:01:26.293
*sigh*

00:01:26.293 --> 00:01:27.804
It's English, for-

00:01:27.804 --> 00:01:29.522
Autism Denial Disorder?

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:31.761
Attention Deficit Disorder!

00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:33.761
I have a hard time concentrating!

00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:36.233
Oh dear. Is that curable?

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:38.233
*bad Belgian accent*
Yes, [amai] in a concentration camp!

00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:39.766
I'm Maya and I'm a Belgian!

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.689
And how can MYMY and I make sure...

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.144
...that you won't be distracted in the next 2 hours?

00:01:55.973 --> 00:01:57.973
What is her motive?

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.535
Why does she try to involve me with everything?

00:02:02.882 --> 00:02:04.882
Does she need something from me?

00:02:05.276 --> 00:02:07.404
Is she conspiring with someone?

00:02:07.404 --> 00:02:08.383
Or...

00:02:08.383 --> 00:02:09.970
...does she honestly believe it would be...

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.520
...fun to be with-

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.010
No, that's impossible.

00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:18.058
She just doesn't believe I can do it by myself.

00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:22.705
Well, in that case...

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:25.889
...there is only one way to prove otherwise.

00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:37.223
W-well Maya...

00:02:37.952 --> 00:02:39.561
...you did it!

00:02:39.745 --> 00:02:43.081
[YOU WON]
It took twelve tries, but-

00:02:49.705 --> 00:02:50.670
Oh no.

00:02:53.831 --> 00:02:54.631
Oh no!

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.923
Oh no...

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.418
Hello!

00:03:27.201 --> 00:03:29.538
Don't mind me it's only me

00:03:29.538 --> 00:03:31.277
See right through me

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:34.102
I'd much rather die than go out

00:03:34.102 --> 00:03:36.248
So please leave me alone

00:03:36.248 --> 00:03:37.998
Don't perceive me

00:03:37.998 --> 00:03:40.802
It's only me

00:03:41.601 --> 00:03:45.790
THIS PART WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY
